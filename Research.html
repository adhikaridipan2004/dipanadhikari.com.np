    <h1>"Our Website: A Mosaic of Ideas from 5 influential Sites"</h1>
    <p id="top-paragraph">
      In the process of building our website, we took inspiration from different
      websites. Five of them are listed below. Each of these sites offered
      unique elements that we admired and incorporated into our own design.
      Below we have provided the details on how each of these websites
      influenced us.

      <div class="websites" id="amazon">
        <h2>Amazon</h2>
        <div class="content-div">
          <h3>Similarities</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our website has a clear and concise navigation bar, similar to the
            one found on Amazon. Especially in products page the color
            combination of the nav bar is similar to the Amazon. Moreover the
            overall color theme of all webpages are similar to them including
            the dark shade of cyan-blue theme in the home page and login page.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Differences</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite being similar color choices the features provided by amazon
            are far more than on our nav-bar. Our website opts for a simpler
            approach, making it easier for users to find what they're looking
            for without feeling overwhelmed

      <div class="websites" id="daraz">
        <h2>Daraz</h2>
        <div class="content-div">
          <h3>Similarities</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            As Daraz is one of the biggest e-commerce site of nepal we have
            taken a lot of inspirations from them. One of them being the hover
            effect on the products when we hover over the each products box.
            Similarly the concept of product box design is taken from the daraz
            website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Differences</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite having similar concepts in many thing our website has many
            Differences from daraz as well. One example may be the detailed
            description of the products. Daraz provides a separate page when
            clicked in the products showing detailed information of product but
            we provide less details of product which shows on same page sliding
            from the see more option.

      <div class="websites" id="flipKart">
        <h2>FlipKart</h2>
        <div class="content-div">
          <h3>Similarities</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are very few similarities of our website from the flipKart
            website. The idea of providing the description of the products
            inside the products box was taken from here. Similarly the heart
            option was also inserted on our site by taking inspiration from
            FlipKart
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Differences</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite the similarity of providing description of the product in
            the same product box, there is the difference of way of showing the
            description in our website. Our website has the feature to only show
            the description of the products when the customer clicks the see
            more option.

      <div class="websites" id="walmart">
        <h2>Walmart</h2>
        <div class="content-div">
          <h3>Similarities</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are very few similarities of our website with walmart, one of
            them being the add to cart button on the product-box.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Differences</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Most of the color theme as well as the design of the website is
            different from the walmart site.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="websites" id="eBay">
        <h2>ebay</h2>
        <div class="content-div">
          <h3>Similarities</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The color theme of the product box is mainly inspired from ebay. It
            has light greyish theme which is similar to what we have on our
            website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Differences</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite being similar colors for the products box, the shape, size
            are different from ebay. ebay has circular product-box where as we
            have a larger rectangle box. Moreover we provide the description of
            the products in the product-box but they don't.
